    "## Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While the scraper is running, I want to find what my goals are for this project. Since I've stuck to using Earnings Calls, the similarity ratings arent all that interesting - we can find details about the companies and classify them without using NLP at all - they're literally categorized into sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyst Opinions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are also not analyst opinions. In the future, I would absolutely want to include analyst opinions, however, for V1 of this project it doesnt make sense. To get a good overview, I'd want multiple different opinions from multiple different sources - I have a list to look at, but these are different websites, and we'd need a different scraper for each one. So thats stressful:) Additionally, sentiments would be the analysts opinion of the company rather than what the earnings said - so it would be more for processing the analysts \n",

    "### The calls themselves \n",
    "I've tried listening to calls - they're so boring. Everyone tries very hard to be very polite and slippery - \"Im not saying anything and Im sure you have a good explanation and its probably a good thing, but it seems youre reporting a lost of billions of dollars, could you please clarify how thats a good thing\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Theyre exhausting to read and exhausting to listen to. Summarize, please.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big Trends? \n",
    "There are a lot of companies. I know whats happening with the big tech ones because I've worked near them - but what about the industry? \n",
    "Can we find common topics between companies that aren't part of the company definitions - how companies are approaching offices, outsourcing, etc. \n",
