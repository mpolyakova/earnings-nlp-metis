# Earnings Calls Are Boring
Earnings calls are exhausting, and boring. The prepared statements tend to be long and very flowery - one could imagine themselves in the court of Henry VIII. The flowery statements, and oblique commentary, with team thanking, and hope for the future is repetitive and exhausting, both to read and to listen to. Earnings calls, however, represent what is important to the company at that stage, and what the leaders are thinking about in the future.  

A collection of earnings calls can represent what the markets and company leaders are generally thinking about. This is valuable for those interesting in finance.  

In this project, I help myself by describing the topics in recent earnings calls, and performing sentiment analysis on them.
