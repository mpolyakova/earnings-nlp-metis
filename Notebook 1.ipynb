Welcome to the DZS fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ted Moreau, head of investor relations.</p> <p>Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Ted Moreau</strong> -- <em>Head of Investor Relations</em></p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Thank you, Catherine, and welcome to the DZS fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining us today are DZS president and CEO, Charlie Vogt; and CFO, Misty Kawecki. Yesterday after market close, we published to the Investor Relations section of the DZS website, a shareholder report for the fourth quarter of 2021, to provide shareholders, prospective shareholders, and analysts with market insights, product, business, and financial updates, as well as forward-looking information. On this call, we will provide projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.</p> <p>The company cautions you that such statements are only current expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. Please refer to documents that the company files with the SEC, including its most recent 10-Q and 10-K reports and the forward-looking statements section of the shareholder report that was filed on a Form 8-K, as well as being available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These documents identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the company's projections or forward-looking statements.

Within the fourth quarter shareholder report, we announced that we will host our Horizons22 investor and analyst day on May 12 at our headquarters in Plano, Texas, that will simultaneously be webcast. I now have the pleasure to turn the call over to Charlie. </p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Thank you, Ted, and welcome investors, analysts, and guests. As Ted shared, yesterday after the market closed, we posted our quarterly shareholder report, which provides a comprehensive update on our business, financial results, market trends, and our 2022 outlook. The communications industry is in the early phase of a dual infrastructure upgrade cycle, where legacy copper and sub-gigabit class infrastructures for the connected home and business are being rapidly replaced by 10-gigabit technologies for symmetrical optical broadband services. In addition, the proliferation of 5G networks is simultaneously creating demand for fiber-connected densification and packet-based networks.</p> <p>This reshaping of the global communications landscape is fueling a wave of experience-driven innovation for high-speed fixed and mobile broadband services for homes, buildings, and cities. DZS is becoming a key enabler of this transformation, providing next-generation broadband connectivity and cloud software platforms that power communication service providers to upgrade their infrastructure and launch new services. Our customers range from the world's most sophisticated advanced fiber and 5G service providers, including 16 of the top 30 global telecom service providers to agile fiber overbuilders, Internet, utility, and municipalities providers. 2021 was a transformational year for DZS, as we achieved record-setting orders, revenue, and backlog.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We began 2021 with a bold vision, a new go-to-market playbook, and $71 million in backlog. In January of 2021, we executed a $64 million follow-on equity raise, strengthening our balance sheet and eliminating our debt. Throughout 2021, we upgraded our leadership and sales team and accelerate innovation across our five centers of excellence, aligned with our broadband connectivity, connected home and business, mobile and optical edge, and cloud software portfolio, which resulted in the introduction of 29 new products. Strong global demand for fiber connectivity, 5G, and optical edge solutions continued during the fourth quarter.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Despite continued supply chain, freight, and logistics constraints, our fourth quarter performance delivered record-setting orders of $134 million, an increase of 47% year over year, record revenue of $98 million, an increase of 11% year over year, a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4, and 47 new customers. For full year 2021, we delivered $504 million in orders, representing a 62% year-over-year increase, record revenue of $350 million, an increase of 16% year over year, and representing $279 million of new orders that were converted to revenue during the year. We closed 2021 with record year-end backlog of $225 million, a 217% increase year over year, and a record 105 new customers, including 86 new customers spanning North America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa. As we enable the deployment of hyper-fast broadband across an expanding customer base, we are creating new opportunities in the communities our customers reach and enhancing the value-added solutions in the homes and businesses they serve.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>We continue to expand and differentiate our fixed and mobile broadband solutions with incremental investments with our cloud software portfolio, specifically our network orchestration, automation, service assurance, and consumer experience solutions. In addition to our network and consumer software portfolio released in 2021, we will unveil sdNOS, our unified Software-Defined Network Operating System in 2022. Our converged edge and cloud software solutions are designed to improve long-term margins and increase our reoccurring revenue while differentiating our fixed and mobile access networking solutions. Shifting my opening remarks to people, I am pleased to announce the appointment of several industry leaders to new roles at DZS.</p> <p>Each brings a deep history of experience in broadband, mobile, optics, and cloud software. Jennifer Yohe joins DZS as our chief operations officer, leading supply chain manufacturing, logistics, and compliance. Jennifer brings three decades of industry experience from Ericsson, MediaKind, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable. Norm Foust joins DZS as our vice president of strategic operations, adding to our talented operations team focused on continued improvement in sourcing, procurement, and manufacturing.</p> <p>Norm has been in the access networking industry, his entire career having led operations at AFC, Calix, and Cyan, which is now part of Ciena. Geoff Burke, who has served as our chief marketing officer for the past two years, transitions to a newly created Chief Strategy Officer role, where he will be responsible for business development, our growing fixed and mobile partner ecosystem, and mergers and acquisitions. Gunter Reiss has joined DZS as our chief marketing officer. Most recently, Gunter led global marketing at A10 Networks.</p> <p>Prior to A10, Gunter spent two decades with Ericsson, bringing to DZS experience in the areas of cloud software, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and mobile networks. Finally, Bernd Hesse joins DZS as vice president of business development. Most recently, Bernd was the senior director of standards marketing and thought leadership at Calix and is currently on the board of directors at Broadband Forum. We begin 2022 with a strong foundation, resulting from the strategic investments in people, product, and systems.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">While we anticipate sourcing, supply chain, and logistics challenges to persist throughout the year, we expect to deliver continued growth, capitalizing on the innovation and customer momentum we created in 2021. We are better prepared than ever to execute on our four growth pillars, specifically the multi-gigabit broadband upgrade cycle, which we expect to last seven to 10 years, the evolution of 4G Mobile to 5G and eventually 6G, our relentless expansion into North America and Europe and the numerous Chinese vendor Cap &amp; Grow opportunities spanning North America, Europe, Middle East, Australia, India and the rest of Pan-Asia. In closing, our industry has never experienced such a simultaneous push from service providers and pull from consumers as we're experiencing today. Adding to the numerous business and technology drivers, broadband is becoming an essential service with an estimated $100 billion of government broadband stimulus.</p> <p>With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Misty, to walk through our Q4 and full year 2021 financial highlights, as well as our 2022 outlook. Misty? </p><p><strong>Misty Kawecki</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a very strong Q4 to wrap up the transformational 2021. Total orders for the fourth quarter reached a record $134 million and revenue in the fourth quarter reached a record of $98 million, an increase of 11% sequentially and year over year, also at the high end of guidance. In Q4, we have successfully capitalized on several of our growth pillars that Charlie mentioned.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">First, demonstrating our success in the multi-gigabit broadband upgrade cycle, broadband connectivity revenue increased 12% sequentially and 18% year over year to $72 million. For the year, broadband connectivity revenue increased 16% year over year to $258 million. Second, reflecting on 5G and Open RAN, our mobile transport revenue increased 9% sequentially to $26 million as we benefited from strong momentum by two marquee customers in Japan. On a year-over-year basis, mobile transport revenue declined 6% after strong spending in 2020.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We are optimistic about our future in 5G and Open RAN as a result of our collaboration with Rakuten Symphony and anticipate additional opportunities from this reference design later this year. Lastly, our overall revenue growth also reflects our success capturing share in North America, a higher-margin region. In the fourth quarter, revenue from the Americas, which is dominated by North America, increased slightly sequentially to $28 million or 29% of total revenue. Comparing year over year, fourth quarter revenue from the Americas increased 52%, demonstrating we have been successfully diversifying our geographic mix throughout 2021.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Rounding out our geographic mix. Fourth quarter revenue from Asia increased 38% sequentially and 4% year over year to $56 million, benefiting from both our broadband connectivity and mobile transport segment. Revenue from EMEA declined 29% sequentially and 13% year over year to $14 million due to the deployment timing of several large projects in the region. Our Q4 adjusted gross margin of 33.6% was within our guidance range and increased 52 basis points year over year, primarily due to our strategic investments and geographic diversification decisions directed toward the higher-margin North America region.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Without the current supply chain challenges and foreign currency exchange during the fourth quarter, we estimate our normalized gross margin performance would have been approximately 39%. In the fourth quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $30 million, which included sales commissions associated with record orders and revenue and a $1 million one-time software license fee. We reported an adjusted EBITDA of $2 million, compared to $0.4 million in Q4 2020 and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.05, compared to negative $0.06 in Q4 2020. Regarding our performance for the full year 2021, we delivered record revenue of $350 million, which increased 16% year over year and exceeded our original 2021 guidance.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Adjusted gross margin for the year improved by 175 basis points to 34.6% despite increased supply chain, freight and logistics costs, reflecting initial operational efficiency progress and favorable geographic mix. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $11 million, compared with $5 million in 2020 and our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.27, compared to a loss of $0.01 in 2020. We have a healthy balance sheet with $53 million in cash and no debt. We've improved our financial flexibility through a new strategic global banking relationship with JPMorgan, which includes a $30 million credit facility.</p> <p>Additionally, our board of directors has approved a new S3 registration statement to replace our existing shelf registration statement that expires in April. Limited component availability over the past several quarters has necessitated increased raw material inventory levels to align with our strong backlog and customer forecast. Our balance sheet has helped support the supply chain constraints. Annualized inventory turns were 4.5 times during the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 5.6x times a year ago.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Days sales outstanding continued to improve to 81 days in Q4 2021 versus 105 days a year ago. Looking ahead, we have a strong visibility of our opportunities, including record backlog entering the year. We anticipate continued supply chain constraints to persist throughout 2022. Combining typical industry seasonality for the first quarter with supply chain headwinds, we are guiding our first quarter revenue to $75 million to $90 million.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We are guiding Q1 gross margins to 33% to 34% and expect operating expenses to decline by $1 million to $2 million sequentially to $28 million to $29 million. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA between a loss of $4 million and positive $2 million. Elevated backlog and strong visibility into customer demand are fueling our 2022 revenue guidance of $380 million to $410 million, and we anticipate greater customer diversity compared with 2021. We are guiding full year gross margin to 34% to 36%.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Operating expenses are expected to be in a range from $112 million to $117 million, resulting in our full year adjusted EBITDA between 17 and $31 million as we benefit from strategic actions implemented over the past year. That completes our prepared remarks. I'd now like to hand the call over to the operator to facilitate the Q&amp;A session. </p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers:</h2><br data-uw-rm-sr=\"\" role=\"presentation\"/> <p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham &amp; Company. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Ryan Koontz</strong> -- <em>Needham and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Thanks for the questions. Really nice growth in the Americas there. I assume that's dominantly U.S.</p> <p>Can you give us any color on kind of where that's coming from across the tier 1, 2s, and 3s or Huawei displacement opportunities? I appreciate that.</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks, Ryan. yeah, As Misty said, most of the growth that we saw in the Americas came specifically from North America. And today, most of our North America revenue is made up of tier 2 and tier 3s. It also -- and I think I tried to highlight it in my opening remarks, I mean, there's a pretty significant emergence of what we see as the sort of next-generation alternative providers in the category of utility, municipalities, fiber overbuilders, the traditional wireless Internet service providers are emerging into fiber-to-the-home service providers.</p> <p>So we're seeing a great opportunity to participate in those nontraditional smaller ILEC service providers.</p><p><strong>Ryan Koontz</strong> -- <em>Needham and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Right. I assume that includes folks like the electric co-ops and power providers, guys like that.</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>That's exactly right.</p><p><strong>Ryan Koontz</strong> -- <em>Needham and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. And then on the gross margins, can you quantify any impact there from supply chain, either logistics or expedite fees, those sorts of things?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. If you remember, in Q3, we talked about the fact that if you eliminated the unforeseen expedite fees and freight and logistics and FX, specifically from Japan, our normalized gross margin in Q3 would have been 39%. And ironically, that same margin model would have existed in Q4 as well. So if you take out the expedite fees and the elevated freight logistics and the FX, specifically in Japan for the yen, on a normalized basis, gross margin in Q4 would have been 39%.</p><p><strong>Ryan Koontz</strong> -- <em>Needham and Company -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. Great. Thanks for the questions. </p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Christian Schwab with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Christian Schwab</strong> -- <em>Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. As far as top-line growth at the midpoint of your guidance is up nicely above 10% given the backlog and the growth drivers that you highlighted not only in the letter, but quickly at the beginning of the phone call. Did you think that we're maybe now in a position where, I guess, thinking over the next few years, do we feel more comfortable of returning to a double-digit top-line growth?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Well, I think if you look at our growth projections for 2022, correct me if I'm wrong, Misty, but I think our range is somewhere between 8% and 16%. So we're certainly on the high end of our projections for the year, well above 10%. And look, I mean, we closed the year with $225 million in backlog. I think the broader range than normal in Q4, as well as in Q1, has a lot to do with just getting comfortable that we can get as much of our backlog out the door.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">I mean, today, of the $225 million in backlog, we estimate that 75% to 80% of it we could ship ASAP from a customer acceptance perspective. So there's close to $165 million to $170 million that we could ship from a customer perspective today if we had access to all the components that represent the solutions that we're selling.</p><p><strong>Christian Schwab</strong> -- <em>Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Well, the supply chain situation hopefully eases at some point, some people hoping maybe as soon as the second half of this year. When you're having discussions with your clients kind of given the recent shocks to the system over the last few years, do you think that your business will be able to maintain strong visibility in backlog? Or do you think that customers will quickly revert to previous buying patterns?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, I don't think we're going to get back to eight to 12 lead times anytime soon. And in fact, we have been pretty cautionary about everyone's expectations with regards to supply chain. I mean I've got to give my team a lot of credit. I think we did a fantastic job navigating, what I think was as almost as bad as it's going to get in 2021.</p> <p>And the fact that we continue to grow throughout the year with record orders and revenue, speaks volumes of what we're doing on the supply chain side. And I think there's something that's very significantly different as we enter 2022, and we entered 2021 and even midyear 2021, and that is the allocation of wafers to our semiconductor partners is much more clear today and their alignment with their partners is much clearer and much more defined than it was in a pretty dynamic environment when most of the manufacturing companies didn't know whether or not they were going to have employees in the factories, manufacturing things from one day to the next. And I think with the vaccines that have now been implemented in virtually all of the countries that we're building products, we've certainly seen a stabilization of the workforce, and that certainly is giving us a lot more assurance that we'll see less disruptions in unexpected manufacturing throughput than what we saw, I think, throughout 2021.</p><p><strong>Christian Schwab</strong> -- <em>Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great Thank you for that. No other questions. Thank you. Great quarter. </p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open. </p><p><strong>Dave Kang</strong> -- <em>B. Riley Financial -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you. Good morning My first question is regarding supply chain situation. How much revenue was impacted?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>You're talking about in Q4?</p><p><strong>Dave Kang</strong> -- <em>B. Riley Financial -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yes, Q4.</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, I think I was saying we -- what I was trying to articulate to Christian's question, we had about 75% to 80% of the backlog and the order flow pre-Q4 and into Q4 that without the headwinds, I mean, we had an opportunity to ship tens of millions of dollars more in Q4 than what we were able to ship.</p><p><strong>Dave Kang</strong> -- <em>B. Riley Financial -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. And regarding your comments on gross margin. So it would have been 39% for both the third and fourth quarter without supply chain costs. And yet you're saying you expect to exit 2023 at 40%.</p> <p>Anticipating overly conservative so -- I mean, you're almost at 40% already, shouldn't 40% occurs much earlier than the fourth quarter next year?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. I mean, look, we spent a lot of time internally thinking through margins and the dynamics that have occurred over the last six months with an entire ecosystem of downstream component suppliers who have raised prices on our entire industry. And as I think I've articulated over the last two quarters, we've taken the position to react and communicate effectively with our customers, partner with our customers to find ways to find a middle ground, and raise prices where it mutually makes sense. And that began in middle of October.</p> <p>We are still working through a lot of the price increases in this first quarter, especially with some of our large tier 1s, where we've got pretty comprehensive contracts that have to be essentially renegotiated. So we expect that the majority of our top 25 customers that represent, let's call it, 75% of our revenue to be completed by the end of this quarter. And so our factors and really thinking through our normalized long-term margins, for me is not having a blip of 40% margins one quarter, and the next quarter, 35%. I think the projections that we gave going back to our Q2 shareholder letter, was a target margin model that really represented what we felt at the time, and this was before price increases that we could get to a steady-state, normalized 40% margin by the end of 2023.</p> <p>And we're still sticking by that. Obviously, the 39% in Q3 and Q4 certainly gives us and demonstrates to us internally that we might be able to get there sooner, but we're not prepared to articulate that externally until such time that we can replicate that on a sustainable basis.</p><p><strong>Dave Kang</strong> -- <em>B. Riley Financial -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. And my last question is regarding RDOF. Regarding 2022 revenue outlook, how much of RDOF revenue is factored in? And how should we think about that going forward beyond this year?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Yeah. I mean, if you look at -- and I think I've tried to explain this to try to level-set everyone that's following the industry. If you look at the RDOF funds, the $20 billion that's been allocated, it's a 10-year path. There's been about $2 billion of that $20 billion that's been released so far.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Of the $2 billion figure, somewhere between 8% and 10% gets allocated to access. So for us, I mean, yes, a lot of our customers have applied for and have been awarded RDOF funds. There's an aggressive path with a lot of our existing customers that are certainly pursuing the $42 billion bipartisan broadband bill that there's a lot of movement there. Remember, we also are participating heavily in U.K.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">and Germany, and there's $7 billion of government funding in the U.K. with the Freedom Fiber program. There's $13 million or $14 million in Germany. There's funds all over the world that we're working very closely with our customers.</p> <p>And so while we don't make it our investment thesis and why we don't -- and why I personally don't amplify the RDOF fund so much, I think that the overall dynamics of what's going on in the industry right now and the drivers in the industry go way beyond broadband stimulus. I mean the demands that are being placed on service providers and the opportunity that service providers have today independent of any funding is significantly greater than it's been in the last decade. So I think that it's in a good way, a perfect storm in the sense that there's financial funds that are supporting a lot of the technology and consumer-driven demands. But if I look at the majority of our customers in the U.S., for example, they're all participating in one way or another in the funds that are available to them.</p><p><strong>Dave Kang</strong> -- <em>B. Riley Financial -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. Thank you. </p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Paul Essi with William K. Woodruff. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Unknown speaker</strong></p> <p>Thanks for taking my question. This is kind of a follow-up on Ryan's question, but maybe you can help us understand where all this business is coming from? Because you guys are putting a lot of focus on North America and Europe, yet you've had pretty entrenched competitors there that are pretty formidable. And if you look around, the space has got strong orders everywhere. So is there just -- maybe this is a big picture question.</p> <p>Is there just so much business out there that is overwhelming the space? And are we possibly in a land grab of sorts? And then also, how much of this business -- I think you may have answered part of my question earlier -- is due to the stimulus that is taking place and when these funds actually begin to flow, do you see another leg up in this demand? And then I've got a quick follow-up.</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Well, I appreciate that we have about 750 active customers around the world and appreciate that in most networks, take aside the small 5,000 line service provider, which we don't spend a whole lot of time in that particular market. Most of the service providers have at least two access networking providers that are participating in the network. So there is growth that multiple companies are having across similar landscapes. So the growth that we're seeing across the entire globe, I mean you look at Korea, where we do business with all three of the incumbent operators in Korea.</p> <p>They're going through a massive upgrade cycle from sub-1 gig to 10 gig. We're seeing the same kind of growth projections across the Pan Asia region, in Japan. We've been really fortunate to be on the leading edge with the upgrade cycle from 4G to 5G and with Rakuten, their proliferation into a new architecture on Open RAN and now with Rakuten Symphony, having spun off and Tareq and team managing and running that company, they're in -- I think, 15, 16 trials were part of their reference design. So I think when you look at DZS, you have to look at us a little differently than maybe ADTRAN and Calix and some of the others, and the fact that we've got three pretty distinct portfolios that are participating in the management of this new demand cycle, whether it's a wireless operator moving aggressively from 4G to 5G, whether it's a wireline operator that's carrying a lot of wireless spectrum from a transport perspective, or it's an access service provider that's providing an upgrade path from sub-1 gig in Europe.</p> <p>I mean if you look at Europe, and we put it in the shareholder report to just try to help people appreciate. But most of the European company, European markets are sub-10% fiber. So the growth opportunity in the investment cycle that is underway across a lot of the European countries is going to be pretty significant for a long time just because of how far behind a lot of those countries are. And look, I mean I would tell you that we're -- we wish that a lot of the Huawei replacement projects were moving faster.</p> <p>But most of the Huawei replacement projects are all tier 1 and tier 2s, and that whole process just takes time. I would say that we feel that we're involved in most every one that is looking to cap and grow some of the Chinese suppliers. So the opportunity, in my opinion, goes way beyond the broadband stimulus funds. I think the demand is there, and I think the demand is going to be there for a number of years because it takes years to upgrade these networks.</p> <p>I mean it's not a one-year or a two-year upgrade cycle. The upgrade cycle takes many years depending on the size of the service provider.</p><p><strong>Unknown speaker</strong></p> <p>And do you expect the level of demand to stay at this level going into next three, four years?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>We do. Because if you just -- if you analyze what has to happen, once a service provider decides to upgrade their network, they've got, for the most part, a set aside number of Capex dollars that they're going to invest in the different parts of their network. And depending on the size and scale of the company, incumbents certainly have a multiyear upgrade cycle. What's exciting to us is also some of the new emerging service providers who are taking share.</p> <p>I mean, I think Ryan had made mention about the co-ops and the utility operating -- I mean the utility companies, the co-ops the state and local governments and municipalities, I mean they're all becoming their own -- they're all participating in the sort of take share sort of environment. And when you're entering a new market and a new business, you have to build the network, independent of what your ultimate take share is going to be. And so the initial build-out cycle for a lot of these new emerging service providers and the wireless service providers who are moving into the fiber-based service provider marketplace, it's going to take a number of years. And what their percentage of the market ends up being is something to be determined.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">But in the meantime, there's a pretty hefty capital spend that's going to take place from our perspective for a number of years. There's also a lot of private equity that's coming in and supporting a lot of our emerging customers. I mean we announced a pretty big strategic partnership with a company called Hosted America, for example. And I think they've allocated $1 billion to fiber over the next several years.</p> <p>So there's a lot of math that's going in at layers onto the existing incumbency and again, not to mention the densification and the magnitude of wireless traffic that is being carried by cable operators and fixed wireline operators, and we're participating in that business on -- with our mobile and optical transport portfolio. </p><p><strong>Unknown speaker</strong></p> <p>Thank you. That's very helpful. One last question. Last spring, you had mentioned about 90% of your orders were coming from preexisting customers.</p> <p>How has that mix changed today? And how do you see that going forward?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>As we mentioned in the shareholder report and in my opening remarks, we added 105 new customers this year, 86 of which stem from North America and Europe specifically. Oftentimes, when you're landing new customers, the initial orders oftentimes, depending on the project, can be smaller because you're in that initial rollout phase. And so we're hopeful that the new customers that we added in 2021 will participate in a much greater way in 2022. That said, when we build our forecast, our forecast is always built based on as much known projects and formalized rollout schedules.</p> <p>Whereas even this year, I mean, we went into this year with an outlook that was lower than what we ended up finishing the year on. And if I were to tell you what the delta was, most of it came from new customers that we secured in '21. </p><p><strong>Unknown speaker</strong></p> <p>OK. Thank you very much. That's all my questions. </p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>And we have a question from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital. Your line is open. </p><p><strong>Tim Savageaux</strong> -- <em>Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey, good morning. Charlie, congrats on the results, especially the strong orders and the double-digit growth outlook. That was kind of going to be the focus of my question. I mean, you've mentioned a couple of metrics here that kind of play into that.</p> <p>But overall, it looks like to the extent you went into '21 with what ended up as 20% of your year in backlog, you now -- that metric is now closer to 60%. And I think you talked about kind of a book ship metric in the year that you're complicitly guiding down something like 40%. So in looking at where you're guiding and also kind of touching on the more customer diversification that was also mentioned on the call, what kind of buckets can we put the dynamics around the guidance? In those buckets might be some moderation among your top customers in Japan that you're expecting, customers ordering farther out, although probably not more than a year out or extended lead times on your part, maybe bucket number two and bucket number three, some degree of conservatism given the environment we're in, trying to get behind that 20% to 60% metric in terms of the backlog. Thanks. </p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Yeah. No, it's a great question. It's a fair question, and we anticipated that there would be questions along these lines. And I actually purposely went out of my way to sort of articulate that in 2021, we converted $279 million of new orders to revenue in the year.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">And in the environment that we were in, it's pretty amazing. And one would ask of $225 million of backlog, of which most of it is scheduled to ship in 2022, why aren't you guiding higher than the high end of the range, especially since you were successful in converting as much new orders into revenue in 2021? And I think it's -- I don't know if I would say, Tim, it's just our conservative nature. I think that we need to make sure that some of the large projects that we have a lot of visibility to materialize in the first half of this year, we think the second half of this year could be materially stronger. But I think that the guidance that we're providing is what we feel like, especially with the allocation of semiconductor chips and so forth that -- I mean that's the real guiding principle right now is while we -- I think we've got a great relationship with Broadcom and others.</p> <p>And we've had a lot of success in 2021. The question is, if we oversize orders in 2022, are we going to be able to have the same success in book ship revenue in the second half of the year based on what feels like a constrained allocation across the entire sector? So if that alleviates and it seems like every time we're on the phone with some of our downstream component suppliers, they're feeling like things are getting a little bit better. Their visibility is getting better. There's less people not coming into work to manufacture products, then you'll see us guide upwards when we have that better visibility.</p> <p>But right now, we just don't feel comfortable guiding more than what we have despite the fact that we have a pretty significant backlog, most of which is scheduled to ship this year just because we don't know whether or not our downstream supplier partners can actually support us on the new orders. </p><p><strong>Tim Savageaux</strong> -- <em>Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. Thanks for that. And just to follow-up briefly on one of those elements, which is on the comments about increasing customer diversification. I guess I want to kind of dig into that a little bit more.</p> <p>I mean on the face of it, that it's likely that you mean you're going to grow the rest of the business larger at a greater rate than you expect out of your two big customers in Japan. But anything more to that in terms of other customer categories emerging as major pieces of the business, maybe the U.S. rural or any other tier 1s that you see stepping up to impact that customer diversification dynamic?</p><p><strong>Charlie Vogt</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. I mean we have 53 new customers in the U.S. in 2021. And so most of those are in the tier 2, tier 3 category.</p> <p>I mean when we acquired Optelian, it certainly gave us an entry into some tier 1s like AT&amp;T and there's a lot of activity that we're pursuing with many tier 1s around the world. And most of the Huawei replacement projects, as I said earlier, are with the large tier 1 and tier 2s. And those decisions tend to be binary, although I certainly feel like DZS is in a really good place. The feedback that we're getting from some of the large customers that we've been knee-deep and proof of concepts that have evolved into trials has been very good.</p> <p>But look, until we sign a contract, until we get an order, it's hard for us to forecast really big numbers because it's binary. And so the forecast that we're sharing in this report and what we're sharing here on this call is based on what we feel is a very high probability. But the wildcard this year and into next year is the success that we may have with some of the projects that we've been working really hard on over the last year.</p><p><strong>Tim Savageaux</strong> -- <em>Northland Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK.

Welcome to the NASDAQ Investor Conference. I'm Simon Flannery, the Comm Infrastructure and Telecom Services Analyst at Morgan Stanley. It's my great pleasure to be joined again by Keith Taylor, Equinix's CFO. Welcome, Keith.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerHey, Simon. Nice to see you again, and thanks for having me -- having me today, and it's great to be here with everybody on the call.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGreat. Looking forward to our discussion. Before we get started, for important disclosures, please see the Morgan Stanley research disclosure website at www.morganstanley.com\\\\researchdisclosures. If you have any questions, please reach out to your Morgan Stanley sales rep.So it's been another good year for Equinix. You put out some constructive medium-term guidance at your Analyst Day back in the summer. Perhaps you could start, Keith, by talking about the priorities for 2022. What are the key areas of focus that we should be aware of?Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Thank you for reminding me to do my forward-looking statement. We will be making some forward-looking statements, so please refer to our SEC documents. And yes, going back to the Analyst Day this past June, we certainly -- I think we sort of said that what I think is the foundation for the business for the next five years and -- and presumably some of the people on the call were on our -- on our -- in our meetings over the last two hours. And so, it was exciting to sort of talk a little bit about our business.First and foremost, I think we have a vision of where we can take the business. And when you think about priorities, which priorities today are the same priorities tomorrow, which is next year, is really about protecting our go-to-market motions, working on our digital services business, expanding our xScale and running the business more efficiently.And part of my -- part of the comments is, look I -- I get really excited about what I think the business can do and we've come off some really good quarters this year. And Q2 to me was -- I mean it was just -- it was -- Q2 and Q3 were just phenomenal quarters. I mean -- and I look back into last year, and I go, when I think about the volume of activity and the way we measure the health of the business is about the amount of gross activity, this is off the charts for us. And so, that's great. Pipeline is deep. I think we have a good vision of what we need to focus on. But it's really is the -- it's the combination of, we see a market that is thriving, we think we're well positioned, we believe we're well positioned as a business. We're investing in places that we need to, including sort of attaching in a more meaningful way to digital services because we think that will be a very relevant aspect for our future.And also, we give you guidance on what we think revenues can do over the next five years. But I would like to think we could do better than that if digital services are as good as they could be, quite open. So a part of that is premised on our ability to invest. It's also thinking about our go-to-market engine. The motion that we have today inside the core business is slightly different than what the motion would be outside in the digital world and sometimes you got to figure out how to make all of that work. And so, part of our decisioning over the last quarters and years has been, how do we invest in our growth and scale, how do we focus in digital, our go-to-market, because it's really a combination of all of those things that will make the, what we guided to on the Analyst Day in June, a reality. And I mean, our goals are always to do better than that. That gives you at least the goal posts at least to sort of guide the business in the modeling exercises.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. So, you mentioned Q2 and Q3 and very strong bookings trends. I think one thing that we really saw coming through in '21 was enterprise demand, and that really seem to pick up. Can you just talk about what's happening on the enterprise side and what has changed with COVID and acceleration of digital transformation and the opportunities from AI and AR/VR, some of the things that really you're most excited about there?Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I -- it's -- I'm going to make a general statement, Simon, because it -- you've known us for such a long time and I think most of the people on -- on this live stream understand, like I've been with the Company from the beginning. And so, see the evolutions and the changes in what goes on in the space has been substantial. But it is also being consistent with what we otherwise would have expected. And this evolution and where we are today, all things feeling more digital.I just feel we're better positioned than ever before as a company, largely because digital traverses through network. And we have 1,800 networks reside in our facilities where we live in a sort of a hybrid multi-cloud environment. We have access to all those cloud and IT services companies. We have all those on ramps, we're focused on cable landing stations. And so whether it's AR/VR, whether it's in artificial intelligence, whether it's in cryptocurrency, and I'm not talking about the mining aspect, but I'm talking about the exchange part of it, which is more akin to our financial services.I should think we're at -- we're at the crossroads of a great opportunity. By building and growing and scaling the business globally and continue to focus on that operational reliability, focusing on the sustainable and the -- and the environmental aspect. All of this I think bodes really well into what our customers are looking for and you throw on -- throw on the side of that, the digital services, which gets them access to our footprint on a global basis, because we sell as a platform.And so, when you ask me what's driving, I think it's all things digital. But I think we're also very well positioned because of our model. And it sits on the foundation of something we created 23 years ago, and we haven't evolved from that and nor should we. I think it is -- it is one of the competitive advantages that we have that is very difficult to displace, if at all.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGreat. I mean you talked about your global scale. Perhaps, you could just give us a quick tour around the regions and where are you most excited about at the moment.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, it's hard not to actually get excited by the U.S. a little bit. Even what's the more mature market or the most mature market, we're going to -- I'm going to -- let's put xScale aside for a little bit. We can talk about that maybe separately. But I think just fundamentally in the U.S. business and understanding what we're doing, understanding the services we provide, where we're investing our dollars, I mean -- I just -- I feel really good about the U.S. business, and it goes back to your comment earlier on about, we're winning a lot of the enterprises, we're winning companies that are moving in some ways because of COVID, but the reality is, things were going to move this way anyway to become more digital. It -- the U.S. seems to -- I feel we are on a different trajectory right now and yes, you know I -- I foresaw some of this because like anything, you saw a churn starting to dissipate not entirely, but you saw the Verizon churn start to dissipate. So that we knew that was going to be good for us.But that's only part of it, but the healthy part is, we've seen more bookings and gross bookings and volume than we've ever seen before, ever seen before in the Americas business, and we have had three record quarters in a row. And the numbers are phenomenal. And so, that's -- so Number 1, that's what I get mostly excited about that. I think Jon Lin, Arquelle Shaw and all the others who work on out of the -- out of the U.S. franchise have done just an excellent job of repositioning the business. But it's also -- it's a function of time as well. We've invested heavily over the coming years, past years and I should have said and I think we're seeing that the -- all the, again, the green shoots of all that -- all that investment.And then Europe, I always feel Europe is a great -- a great market for us. One, it's extremely diverse and we're just well positioned across all these countries that we operate in. And we're investing. Our -- when you go through the expansion tracking sheet and go wow look at the investments we're making across the European theater and recognizing when the flat markets but even more so where we will extend it out to the emerging markets, the global -- we call them the GEMS, global emerging markets. And it is nice to see the momentum we see in Spain, in Italy, in Ireland, you can go through the sort of walk around the different parts. And so, it's just great to see, but I feel we're well positioned as well. So that will continue, as I said, because of last year and some of the adjustments we made and then the pricing, I think you will see probably a more appropriate growth rate in Q4 for the European theater.And Asia is always intriguing to me. Singapore has been phenomenal. Sydney has been -- Sydney and Melbourne and some of our other Australian assets have performed very well. Tokyo, very, very attractive. Question mark on China. Question mark on Hong Kong. And I just -- I feel good about our overall business.But you take sort of that and see well look, the three regions that I feel -- overall there's going to be good markets, bad markets, that's just the nature of our business [Phonetic], we're in 66 markets. That is where we have been investing. So we're going deeper into Turkey. We brought into India, as you know. We bought into Mexico. We want to do more in the Indian market. We're already looking at what the next opportunity set is, vis-a-vis markets. We're in Mumbai, but how do we get to Chennai, Bangalore and others. We're buying land, we're getting -- procuring land in India.You then think about well, what about Africa, we're not there yet. We've telegraphed it. We want to be in Africa, we want to get to Africa, that opportunity set. Mexico bought Axtel, we're seeing momentum there and now you're seeing all the project starting to stack up in the Mexican market.What about other parts of South America, what about Southeast Asia, Singapore has got some restrictions, I think as many of you know. So we're also going to find our growth. We're going to go at it. So if you think about Singapore, naturally, you go -- naturally you probably think about Hong Kong, but Hong Kong feels like a place that is going to struggle for a period of time. We did find last quarter, but overall, it's a nice market for us, but I'm not sure that's where we want to make our next investment dollar or where our customers want to make their next infrastructure decision and maybe on the margin we'll a [Phonetic] little bit, but not the big decision.So we think about, well, what about Sydney, what about Tokyo, what about India, what about other Southeast Asian markets in Jakarta -- in Jakarta, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. So I'm excited about what we're doing as a business. We're just expanding our platform broader and wider than it's ever was anticipated. And I think that bodes really well because when you attach -- attach the digital services to it, that means you're -- you as a customer can be instantly global by coming to Equinix.We have the physical assets, we have the digital services to connect you to wherever you need to be in the world. And if you don't want to deploy your own infrastructure, we have Metal. That feels like -- that feels like a winning -- winning solution. So I will tell you Metal is hard, it's hard right now with the enterprise, so -- because you got it, it's like anything, you make these decisions and obviously we're seeing good quarter-over-quarter growth. But it's have we seen the lift off that we need yet and that's -- that's still I think hands on to comment. Metal was not a big part of our business, thankfully, but we want it to be a bigger part of our business for sure, on a go-forward basis.Simon Flannery -- AnalystThat makes sense. Coming back to the digital services, I mean, one of the areas we get a lot of questions on is MRR trends over time. And it relates a little bit to pricing power and we're obviously in this inflationary environment, there's a focus on ability to have pricing power. So perhaps just talk us through what you're seeing on pricing, on renewals and remind us of your kind of annual escalators in your contract base, et cetera.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Well, there's a lot in there. I think one of the things I said on a prior call this morning, I think one of the advantages that we have is that we are a destination, we are a platform, we have an ecosystem and with that has come higher pricing. So when you look at our price points, remember I -- I -- we share with you every quarter what our prior average comps of prices, it's a composite, things are going to move around a little bit depends on timing of installations and all of that and as we get bigger and bigger, then there'll be less volatility in that number.But you can see the bias has always been up into the right and we talk about firm pricing. And so, as the U.S. dollar number and as you increase your pricing on cross connects, so if you sell more incremental services, that price point moves up on an ARPU basis. But I think the more fundamental question is, what is the spot price and I would say that we -- we get a price point that very few get. We look for 20% to 30% return on our money before you put debt on the business.We've been enjoying that for a period of time. We've got the lowest cost of capital on the business. And see -- so even on the margin, again markets will be different. Tokyo is going to be a different returning market than say a Singapore. But when you look at our cost of capital, we don't arb over cost to capital. We expect to return on the -- when that team looks for -- for us to make an investment decision, we're going to measure them against everybody else, and say, well I can get 20% over here or 30% over here, why would I do something at 15% or 11%.And so, we're very disciplined number one at that, so getting the right return profile. But it's because we also know what the empirical data is, what is the price point in the marketplace, what is the fuel rates, what are we assuming for large footprint and it's all of that that comes together allows us to enjoy what I think is the pricing environment for us, that -- that is much more predictable. And we enjoy that because we live in an ecosystem, we have an asset I think is -- we have assets they look good, feel good, that are in the right markets, they are high -- we operate with high reliability, but they also sit on top of our bedrock, our networks, our cloud and IT services company, so pricing overall, I feel very, very good, good about.And you've seen us in select cases move pricing up, cross connects in Europe. We knew that where we want it to be as a company and the value we're bringing to the table, we felt that it wasn't reflected in the price points and that was because of market conditions and how the market evolves in Europe relative to the other regions of the world. So feel good about that.I think about churn, churn is largely because of Verizon, less big deals in our system today. Churns feels good, it feels it's going to be in the lower end of the range as we said. And that feels good, and we have churn because we have a ecosystem in a thriving market, customers can come and go, and the customer typically doesn't leave, but they -- their deployments change and evolve and so we always measure gross activity. Yes, we report to you net activity, because ultimately that's over represent itself in our financial results. But the health of the system is based on the amount of gross activity because we want customers to come in and try and buy and change and move to different markets and all that.And so, the -- I mean the last part, which is really about inflation. So what's the environment like today. I think you're hearing from many a company, there is an upward bias on price, because we are in a period that I think requires a price adjustment, is reflective -- should be reflective of market conditions and yes, we still get -- we're still going to get nice returns in our business. But I also think that you've got a higher utility costs, higher labor costs, higher material costs and at some point you've got to get a return on that investment. And the market expects it.It's like, you know you're going to pay more for your milk, it is, if you're a consumer. You know you're going to pay more for your fuel, and you just go to the gas pumps today and you feel it. Well, I mentioned that translates into what happens in the commercial world and -- and if you will, in the corporate world and so people who will have to pay more for their services over time because their costs are going up and we can't eat them all, some we eat and some we don't eat. So I think the industry as a whole will have to adjust accordingly.If I -- again, I mentioned on one of the earlier calls today, I said one, if you think about the floor, I think the hyperscalers are a perfect example. They say look, I know what you -- I know what it's going to cost me to build. I'm going to let you build that for me, I'll sign long-term contract and so you price to return. So they said, I know what you corresponding that, we'll disaggregate it, we'll put it back to you and so this is what your return and we've always said 8% to 12%. Our cost of capital is the lowest in the industry. And we've been driving our cost of capital. We don't arb over our cost of funds as you know, as I said.And so, if that's the floor, even if we just played in the xScale game which would be highly consumptive of our balance sheet, it's still going to get a -- it's a good returning business relative to your cost. That's not what we want to play. We want to play in the stuff that's the high value stuff and that returns of 20% to 30% that I referred to allows us to make the investments we need to scale the business to where we want it to be.And as a company, I think we're just being very disciplined about investing today for tomorrow's opportunity, because we can't -- you can't get there without investing today. Because you can't wait to be a $10 billion company to invest in $10 billion infrastructure. You'll crush under the weight as I said. So that -- so hopefully, that gives you a sort of a broad set of just the things that we're thinking about and the escalators are everyone's negotiated differently. It depends on the customer and the contract, but overall, we're looking at 3% to 5% is typical, sometimes it's 2%. It just depends on who the customer is and what they negotiated and the point that they started from.And again, it's not a loss to new signing that we always talk about net pricing actions and if it's net positive, that tells you and the bias has always been net positive probably for the last 10 years -- 10 or 15 years and you can tell that where the price decreases are being absorbed by the price increases and then we get more and that's always very accretive to our MRR per cabinet metric and reflective to the overall value of the business.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGreat. And how does this all flow through to your margin? A lot of your energy costs are passed through or hedged and you certainly talked about the margin opportunity at the Analyst Day over the medium to long term.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Well, again, the discussions we've had today already and certainly ones I had post earnings call, the discussion around power consumption and utility rates certainly is the forefront of everybody's mind. So what I would tell you is two things. Number 1, we're not gearing away from what our commitments are, 3% -- 7% to 10% AFFO per share growth and margins of...Simon Flannery -- AnalystThrough '25 [Phonetic].Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerThrough '25. And what -- that explain that to me, I said well look, I can't get to 7% to 10% growth, if I don't grow my margin. We've -- if you will, we've already found efficiency on the below the line activity. Our tax rate is -- tax rate is going to go up. We're a U.S. REIT, so we don't pay tax in the U.S., but we are -- we are a tax payer in all of the markets outside the U.S. and tax rates are going up and we're going to earn more profits in foreign [Phonetic] jurisdictions and so, our taxes will be going up.So in order to get that number, we got to run the business more efficiently and we got to drive the margin into the business. And so, that's why I'm confident that where we solve the problems that are thrown at us and this isn't the first rodeo that we've been at. I've been in the business, as I said for 23 years, working for this company, a lot of us have been here long time, we've seen a lot of these things come and go.And the reality is, the utility issue, three things are going to happen. Some of it we're going to absorb, some of it we're going to pass through to the customer and some of it is going to be metered and so how do we run the business to drive efficiency and that's to offset some of the challenges if we've got a rising price environment and so you can raise macro pricing across the board to be reflective of in the global environment. But if you're dealing just specifically with the utility price, then that's how it's going to happen, it will be metered, it will be passed through metered price increase on a targeted basis in the markets that are affected or we'll absorb some of it, because that's what we've done in the past. We don't necessarily -- as a company, we absorb both the good and the bad. And -- but if it's an outsized move, then we'll deal with it with our customers.Simon Flannery -- AnalystRight. I'd be interested to get your thoughts on the recent industry consolidation. It's been a remarkable kind of pace of deal making and good to see, you're so trading as a public company for investors to invest in, but one feature we saw recently was American Tower for CoreSite theme, this sort of convergence theme where we see different elements of communications infrastructure coming together and it plays into edge compute and things like that. So if a private equity continuing to invest more money in this space, so how does -- how does that strike you in terms of the implications for the industry going forward?Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. I have many a thoughts, some I don't want to say -- say on this live stream.Simon Flannery -- AnalystJust you and I.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. It -- let me start off by saying, it doesn't surprise me that QTS, CoreSite and CyrusOne are all being consumed by somebody else. Just doesn't surprise me and largely because if you recall some of the comments I made particularly around CyrusOne and QTS as they were -- they had a lot of leverage on their books as a public company. So a lot of leverage on their books, they're doing the way that they were getting their growth in scale was really through large footprint deals and those -- those are certainly they are out there, but you can't live and die by the quarter of the year based on these big deals and they were very disruptive to balance sheets. And hence why we talked about xScale for that comment -- that discussion a little later.So Number 1, I thought I mean, eventually they're going to have to be bought or they're going to have to do something. So that's playing in a space that I again we dabble in it with xScale. We've got $7.5 billion of capital committed to 35 projects and when I say dabble, I mean it's a big dabble, but it'll add -- it will be 3% to 5% additive to our AFFO per share at maturity and obviously as we continue to scale that, that adds real value to the business.So I think about that -- I think about CoreSite, CoreSite for a lot of reasons again, the asset -- the stock has traded well. They just haven't been growing, so it wasn't investing in its future. And its dividend payout ratio was so high that it really had to think about its capital structure. And so, when AMT has agreed to buy it, that didn't really surprise me as well, but it surprised me. It's one of those things, but that's not a surprise, but it's a surprise, in that you understand the Tower stocks are starting to think about other ways to integrate their businesses. And I think if this current castling of -- they've got the fiber assets, the AMT has been dabbling into data center assets, I think it was current castle, maybe I'm wrong.So you see this verticalization taking place. But I'm not convinced yet, why, because the questions get asked, how do you feel about the edge. And they go, well the far edge, I'm not sure that's a place that we want to play. When we bought Switch and Data's assets in 2010, we dispensed off a number of the smaller tier markets and we focused on the bigger markets generally and we will be in other bigger markets around the world.And I think we're -- if you really believe in the digital world, a lot of that capacity is going to get consumed where the eyeballs are, where people consume and people distribute and that's in the major metros and so deploying capital that will be against like sub-scale or you want enjoy the economies of scale like you do when you build a big data center and it's always been a little bit of a head scratcher for us.Yes, we're watching. Yes, I guess we're focusing, but I don't think we need to make that bet and so others will make that bet and have made that bet, but I'm not convinced that makes a difference today and to a extend it does, then we'll react. But we want to deploy the capital, one of the things I said earlier on, is our best returning capital is putting it back into the ground, that's the best return. So if I can get 20% to 30% unlevered, you want us to keep on doing that, investing and growing the business, driving our margins up and I just think that's much more attractive model than worrying about what's happening at the edge right now and because we have digital services, we are -- we're a global company. Enterprises want to come to us.This new digital world that we live in, as I said before, you can be instantly global with Equinix. And one -- effectively one vendor who can manage it all for you and some of it's not easy, I directly admit that and we're working hard on some things, but overall, I just think we're a better place to be and so dabbling at the base of the cell tower at the micro edge or far edge, just doesn't feel like we need to be there yet.Simon Flannery -- AnalystYes. Alright. Well, unfortunately we're starting to come up on time here, Keith, but an area where Equinix has been one of the leaders has been on ESG and you've done a number of green financings and what I'd be really interested in is, what are you hearing from customers, what are they demanding, what are you positioning your organization to kind of be receptive to their needs? And in terms of data center builds and other areas and then also that question around municipalities, because they're obviously looking at energy requirements, data centers and water requirements and it'd be great to get your perspective there.Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerWell, looking the, if you will, the E and the S, we'll leave the G on the side for a moment. Environment is critically important for all of us for obvious reasons, it's the forefront of all the news, the news reels and people care. It's not just whether our customers care, our communities care, our employees care, certainly our investors care, but actually our customers care now for all those reasons that their communities and their employees care.And so being a core component of critical infrastructure, we got to respond to that and we're taking a very broad stance. We're at the forefront as you would expect, we're the leader in the industry. We're also the leader in our views on environmental and we're going to work exceedingly hard to get to 100% renewable. Now some of it you got to do indirect. I can't do it at the data center level. I can't do it in Singapore and Hong Kong or other markets. So you got to find indirect ways to compensate for your consumption.But the other thing we need to do is, we got to operate more efficiently. We have to look at new technologies. We have made commitments to science-based targets. We made commitments to carbon neutrality. We're making commitments to all sorts of other initiatives that support the social framework, around electric vehicles and car allowances and there's things that we will do as a company that will surprise you, but it's all in -- it's all for the betterment for -- of the environment and I think for the industry. But I also think for us.We'll put ourselves in a competitive advantage if we make these investments and they are investments by the way. Don't necessarily get paid for them, but they are investments. We'll also enter into more indirect power arrangements. As it relates to the social side, we're investing heavily in that and I got to applaud my man Charles for that. Charles when he took over the CEO role, he pushed -- he really pushed hard in our company and our view on diversity, inclusion and belonging and you see that at the Board level already. You certainly are starting to see it inside the organization. I think our social commitments are real. And again, we want to be careful how far we go and the positions we take, but the reality is between ES and hopefully G, we want to be an industry leader, we want the others to chase, because we think there will be an advantage to us.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGreat. Well, that's a great overview, Keith. We really appreciate your time today, and thanks everybody for joining us and...Keith D. Taylor -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.Simon Flannery -- AnalystGood luck with the rest of the day.Keith D.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for being on the call. Phillips Edison Company is exclusively focused on owning and operating neighborhood, grocery-anchored, omnichannel shopping centers. We are one of our nation's largest owners of this type of center.</p> <p>As we speak today, you will notice that we call our tenants our neighbors. We do this, because we work hard to create community at our centers, and we treat our retailers as neighbors in that community. We also prioritize customer service and believe that this nomenclature reminds our team to treat our tenants like we would our neighbors. When it comes to our centers, we believe that format drives results and also facilitates attractive long-term growth.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>Our average center is 115,000 square feet, which is among the smallest average size in the REIT universe. We believe our smaller centers allow for better growth because of our average tenant space of 2,300 square feet aligns well with leasing demand. Approximately 70% of leases in strip centers are executed in spaces smaller than 2,500 square feet. This demand drives higher retention rates, higher releasing spreads and overall positive leasing dynamics for PECO.</p> <p>Higher retention rates result in less downtime, lower TI costs and higher NOI growth. When it comes to our properties, our strategy is simple. We focus on owning centers with the No. 1 or No.</p> <p>2 grocer in the market. Our centers have an omnichannel neighbor base where the grocer and the center have both delivery and buy online and pick up in the store or BOPIS capabilities. Our centers have a high exposure to neighbors selling necessity-based goods and services. In fact, 72% of our rent comes from neighbors offering both necessity goods and services.</p> <p>We focus on owning centers in trade areas with favorable demographics where our neighbors can be successful. Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth. Our long-term growth includes both strong external and internal growth. We improved our balance sheet with the capital we raised during our underwritten IPO last July.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Subsequently, we executed our debut $350 million public bond offering as our investment-grade issuer. With our leverage currently at 5.6 times debt-to-EBITDA, our goal is to execute $1 billion of acquisitions, net of dispositions over three years. Our strategy creates significant opportunity for acquisitions, which I'll discuss later. This external growth will complement our strong internal growth over the long term.</p> <p>The key drivers of our internal growth include, growing rents through new and renewal leasing spreads, executing leases with annual fixed rental increases, leasing vacant space to new neighbors and executing redevelopment opportunities, which are primarily single-tenant, ground-up, outparcel developments and tear down and rebuild opportunities for our grocer anchors. We believe our strategy has historically and will continue to prospectively generate superior risk-adjusted returns. We do believe that format drives results. Our differentiated strategy allows us to realize higher initial yields on acquisitions, plus higher NOI growth, plus lower capex.</p> <p>This leads to superior economic returns. Our results in the fourth quarter were no exception. The fourth quarter continued the momentum we have seen through 2021. For the full year, we exceeded our annual core FFO per share and same-center NOI guidance.</p> <p>The key components of our results are as follows. The operating environment remains as strong as we have seen it in our 30 years in the business. Our rent collections are at pre-pandemic levels. We enjoyed continued high demand for retail space in our well-located small format centers.</p> <p>We realized strong internal growth. Leased occupancy reached an all-time high of 96.3%. Comparable new and renewal rent spreads were healthy at 18.3% and 7.8%, respectively. On average, our new and renewal in-line leases executed in the fourth quarter had annual contractual rent bumps of 2.4%.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We also realized strong external growth. We continue to execute our goal of acquiring $1 billion of real estate by June of 2024. Since our IPO in July, we acquired $350 million of assets, which we believe meet our internal return requirement of an 8% unlevered IRR. Looking forward, we believe the strong operating environment enhances our ability to execute our internal and external growth plans.</p> <p>It positions us for meaningful long term growth. John will provide more details on our outlook in a few moments during our 2020 guidance discussion. Now I would like to turn it over to Devin who will speak in more detail about our operating results for the quarter. Devin?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our differentiated strategy of owning and operating small format centers anchored by the No. 1 or No.</p> <p>2 grocer continues to generate strong results and resulted in positive results for the fourth quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, lease portfolio occupancy totaled 96.3%, compared to 94.7% at December 31, 2020. Occupancy reached an all-time high in the quarter. Anchor leased occupancy increased to 98.1%.</p> <p>In-line leased occupancy increased to 92.7%. Our leased occupancy to economic occupancy spread was 100 basis points for the quarter, primarily as a result of our anchor leasing activity. Our in-line spread compressed to 80 basis points this quarter. We believe that we can increase in-line occupancy to 95% over time, which will add approximately 70 basis points to our total occupancy rate.</p> <p>During the quarter, we executed 121 new leases and 132 renewal and option leases, totaling 1.4 million square feet of space. We have leased approximately 1.4 million square feet now for four consecutive quarters, illustrating the continued strong demand from retailers for space at our centers. Comparable new lease rent spreads were 18.3%, and comparable renewal leased rent spreads were 7.8%. Our in-house leasing team has been busy executing new in-line leases with neighbors, including Sports Clips, Dunkin Donuts and retailers for many different lines of necessity retail.</p> <p>Demand for our retail space is coming from retailers in many different businesses. A growing trend that we have seen is national retailers such as Chipotle, Starbucks and Humana, looking to expand their footprints in our suburban markets. Additionally, we have a dedicated renewals team focused exclusively on keeping our existing neighbors in our centers. We enjoyed a retention rate of 86% for the quarter, which is just shy of our full year retention rate of 88% and in line with our 2017 to 2020 average retention rate of 87%.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We believe our retention rates are market leading. These high retention rates are important because we suffer no downtime and have to invest less tenant improvement dollars into the space. In Q4, our average TI for renewals was only $1.29 per square foot, and for the year averaged $0.95 per square foot. No downtime and lower TIs results in better cash flow growth.</p> <p>These solid retention rates are evidence that our retail space is a great place for our neighbors to successfully operate their businesses. An important part of our internal growth story is redevelopment. During the quarter, we stabilized two ground-up outparcel developments. One at Plaza 23 in the Newark, New Jersey MSA and one at Alameda Crossing in the Phoenix MSA.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">This additional GLA of 7,300 square feet is fully leased, and the neighbors took possession of the space during the quarter. We have 17 additional redevelopment projects that we began during 2021. The total projected cost for these ground-up redevelopment project is $45 million. We currently expect incremental underwritten yields on these projects to be between 10% and 12% unlevered.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Our pipeline currently includes eight additional projects in 2022, which represents an additional $23 million of investment. We expect this pipeline of redevelopment opportunities to grow throughout the year. For full year 2022, we expect to invest approximately $45 million to $50 million in ground-up and redevelopment opportunities. In addition, we expect to spend $50 million to $55 million on capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions at our centers.</p> <p>The results that I just reviewed exhibit the strong operating environment that we currently enjoy and believe we'll continue to enjoy through 2022. I will now turn the call over to John for a discussion of our financial results, our recent capital markets activity and our 2022 financial guidance. John?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Thank you, Devin, and good afternoon, everyone. Fourth quarter 2021 NAREIT FFO increased 7.3% to $49.4 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Fourth quarter core FFO increased 24.5% to $60.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share. The increase in both NAREIT and core FFO for the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven by increased revenue at our properties and improved collections.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Further driving the increase was a reduction in interest expense versus the fourth quarter of 2020. We had a non-cash charge of $7.4 million for our earn-out liability in Q4 2021, impacting our NAREIT FFO. And we expect an additional charge in the first quarter of 2022, totaling $1.8 million to cover the final settlement of the earn-out in January 2022. Approximately 1.6 million operating partnership units were delivered in January, marking the end of the earn-out period.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">As we look at the fourth quarter, our general and administrative expenses were higher than other quarters, primarily due to performance-based compensation on our short and long term incentive programs realized in the quarter. We anticipate our full year 2022 G&amp;A to be in line with our full year 2021 G&amp;A, which was $48.8 million. Also in the quarter, our capital expenditures were higher on a run-rate basis than other quarters due to timing and increased tenant improvement dollars spent in the quarter, driven by the high volume of leasing activity. Compared to 2020, our NAREIT and core FFO per share results were impacted by a 15% increase in our weighted average share count as a result of issuing 19.55 million shares during our July 2021 IPO.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">For the full year, our core FFO per share of $2.19 exceeded the high end of our guidance of $2.14 to $2.18. Several things lined up for us during the quarter, which pushed our results above the top end of our guidance. We had a number of acquisitions in the pipeline that we were able to close before the end of the year. Our occupancy increased and exceeded expectations.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Our neighbors began paying rent more quickly than anticipated and our prior-period collections were higher than expected. We still have a little over $3 million outstanding on payment plans with our neighbors. We will continue to be conservative in our estimates for collections at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2022, which I will get to shortly. Our fourth quarter 2021 same-center NOI improved to $88.8 million, up 15.2% from a year ago.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">This improvement was primarily driven by a 2.4% increase in average base rent per square foot, stronger collections, compared to 2020 and out-of-period collections for the quarter of $2.3 million. When comparing our results for the quarter ended December 31, 2019, our same-center NOI increased 3.9%. We believe this is a true indicator that we are experiencing growth in our same-center portfolio above and beyond the COVID recovery. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $604 million of total liquidity comprised of $116 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, plus $489 million of borrowing capacity available on our $500 million credit facility.</p> <p>As of December 31, 2021, our net debt to adjusted EBITDAre was 5.6 times, compared to 7.3 times at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, our debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% and a weighted average maturity of 5.2 years. Approximately 99% of our debt is fixed rate. Our debt ratios and maturities have improved as a result of our IPO in July and debut public debt offering that closed in the fourth quarter.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">The $350 million 2.625% coupon 10-year notes significantly extended our debt maturity profile, while also diversifying our capital sources. Given our growth plans and maturity profile, we believe we can become a serial issuer in this market. On February 10, we filed a shelf registration statement and a $250 million ATM equity offering program. Following our July IPO, this is the logical next step for us and allows us to efficiently access the capital markets as opportunities arise.</p> <p>We have no immediate plans to utilize the ATM program, but wanted to have this option available to us as we continue to evaluate market conditions and capital needs. Yesterday, on February 10, 2022, we issued our 2022 full year guidance in our earnings release. For 2022, our same-center NOI growth guidance is between 3% and 4%. This is consistent with the growth we have delivered on a historical basis and what we believe we can continue to deliver going forward.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Our NOI growth will be one of the core drivers for our core FFO growth. Additionally, we expect to see a reduction in interest expense due to less debt on our balance sheet. For 2022, our core FFO guidance range is between $2.16 and $2.24. When compared to 2021, we expect total core FFO to increase by approximately 11% to $282 million using the midpoint of our guidance.</p> <p>With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff to discuss our recent portfolio activity, provide our 2022 acquisition guidance and recap our long term growth strategy. Jeff?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Thanks, John. Following our IPO in July of 2021 through December 31, 2021, we acquired seven grocery-anchored centers and two outparcels for $267.4 million. This was at the high end of our guidance range. So far, in 2022, we've acquired two additional grocery-anchored shopping centers for $82.9 million and have an additional center under contract for $17.5 million.</p> <p>Our 2022 acquisitions included Cascades Overlook in Arlington, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. This 151,000-square-foot center is anchored by Harris Teeter, a Kroger banner. And Oak Metals Marketplace in Georgetown, Texas, which is in the Austin suburb. This 79,000-square-foot center is anchored by Randalls, an Albertsons banner.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We believe the centers we have acquired since our IPO will meet or exceed our unlevered IRR target of 8%. Our acquisition pipeline is healthy. For 2022, we are guiding to acquire between $300 million and $400 million of assets net of disposition activity. As we have discussed in the past, we identified 5,800 grocery-anchored shopping centers in the United States that fit our strategy.</p> <p>These centers are all anchored by the No. 1 or No. 2 grocer in their respective markets and meet our demographic requirements. We are focused on the three mile area around each center.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We believe this strategy presents a wider and deeper pool of assets to choose from versus a strategy strictly focused on a limited number of markets. To meet our stated goal of $1 billion of net acquisitions by June of 2024, we need to acquire approximately 15 assets per year. This represents approximately 2% of our targeted shopping centers that trade each year. We are well on our way to meeting our $1 billion goal.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">To optimize our internal growth, we will continue to selectively recycle assets. These proceeds will be deployed into higher quality, higher growth assets. Since our IPO, we have disposed of 11 wholly owned centers, two outparcels and one land parcel, totaling approximately 1.1 million square feet for $91.7 million. This was slightly below the low end of the guidance range of $95 million to $105 million, which we gave on our third quarter earnings call.</p> <p>Now before we get to the Q&amp;A section, I would like to quickly recap our quarter. The operating environment remained strong. We realized strong internal growth. We also realized strong external growth.</p> <p>Our differentiated strategy produced strong results for the quarter and have set high expectations for 2022. With that, we'll begin the Q&amp;A portion of our call. Operator?</p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers:</h2><br data-uw-rm-sr=\"\" role=\"presentation\"/> <p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Rich Hill at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Rich Hill</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey, guys. First of all, congrats on a really nice quarter. I wanted to talk through the guide. It is very strong on an absolute and relative basis compared to your peers.</p> <p>And I wanted maybe just to understand and unpack a little bit more if there's something differentiated about your portfolio. Many of your peers talked about bad debt being a headwind in 2022. And I think, back to your portfolio already being above 2019 levels on a same-store NOI basis. So I guess, that's a long way of saying, is there something different about your portfolio? Do you not have as much bad debt or is this really about your portfolio just holding up and bouncing back a little bit better than peers, which is leading to a guide that looks really strong?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah, Rich, thanks for the question and being on today. As you know, we really do believe that our -- that format drives results. And we do think that our format of having the grocery store with the necessity-based goods does perform -- has performed well during the pandemic and we'll continue to do that going forward. So I would say that we are optimistic about the year, but we also -- we've taken a really hard look and we think these are achievable goals for us and we wouldn't have there if we didn't believe that.</p> <p>So I would say that, overall, it is the format that we've got that I think is driving use results. But John, do you want to give or Devin a little more detail on that?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure, thanks, Jeff. And thanks for the question, Rich. So as we look at it, the biggest component to the core FFO growth is really the NOI growth. And so, our peers have talked about the bad debt impact.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">And ultimately, because our impact in '21 was not as significant as we go to '22, we've got a base of stability. So we've been communicating and our properties have been operating in a new world of post-COVID world. And ultimately, it's a combination of the organic growth that we're driving, as well as the acquisitions that we've been able to make and that were projected to make. And so, just to get ahead of the question that I'm sure I'll be asked, the impact on the quarter specifically of out-of-period collections is about $2.3 million.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">So that's the quarter that was kind of the bad debt reversal in the quarter. And as we look to the next year, we only have $3 million of payment plans outstanding left. And so, as we looked at our guidance on a same-store basis and on an FFO, we do anticipate collecting that and it is kind of -- it is accounted for in the upper end of our guidance.</p><p><strong>Rich Hill</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. Thank you. And if I may, just one more question. I know you guys focus on unlevered IRRs when you're acquiring properties.</p> <p>So forgive a sell-side question here. But could you maybe give a little bit of a guidance on what the cap rates for your acquisitions would be in 2022?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Hey, Rich, thanks for being on the call this morning. Where we are acquiring assets, Rich, today in the market is between a low of 5.75% and up to 6.75%. So it's in that range that we are acquiring assets. And you'll note that for full year '21, the weighted average cap 6.4% on acquisitions.</p> <p>And in the first quarter, the cap rate was almost 6%, just under 6%. So it's in that range and that's where we expect it to stay on a go forward.</p><p><strong>Rich Hill</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. So somewhere between 6% and 6.25% for 2022, maybe as tight as 5.75%. OK. I got it.</p> <p>Thank you, guys. Congrats on a good quarter again.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks very much.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.</p><p><strong>Caitlin Burrows</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe one on occupancy. You guys had some meaningful increases in occupancy in the third quarter. And again, in the fourth quarter, Devin, I think you mentioned that you think in line occupancy could get to 95%, increasing occupancy 70 basis points overall.</p> <p>So I was just wondering if you could give some more detail on your expectations for 2022? And given the strong operating environment, how much additional increase is realistic near-term?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Yeah, thanks, Caitlin, as you saw both in the fourth quarter and through full year '21, we were successful in increasing our occupancy to the level that we're currently reporting. We've guided on that occupancy increase to occur over the next two years. So we believe that we will get that in-line occupancy up to 95% over the next 24 months. And how much of that we're going to get in '22 is hard to know, but based on how strong the pipeline is currently, we will probably get a meaningful component of that in calendar year '22.</p><p><strong>Caitlin Burrows</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. OK. And then, maybe just one on development. You guys have a number of development and redevelopment projects, and it looks like a few had either the stabilization quarter, pushed out a little or a little change in cost.</p> <p>So just wondering if you could give some detail or background on the trends you're seeing in time to complete projects and also on the cost side and the impact that has on PECO?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Sure. So on our redevelopment, Caitlin, you know that they are smaller redevelopments, and therefore, they have shorter cycle times. And so, that makes it a little bit easier for us to anticipate when they're going to come online. We have seen increases in costs and we have included those increases in costs in our budgeted numbers and the returns that we've articulated include the increases that we're seeing on costs.</p> <p>Where we are seeing delays is in the permitting process, and then in some instances, in terms of the availability of the necessary goods. But all of that is built into our expectations. And therefore, the numbers that we gave in our earnings release, we're confident we will deliver on. And we continue to be very happy with the kind of returns we're able to generate on this activity.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>And Caitlin, we are seeing -- we continue to see really strong demand for these particular outlet. So we are -- I would say, we're optimistic that we will continue to have that strong demand from the retailers looking to expand into these locations. So we're -- and we're not seeing anything on the leasing side. There is some stuff on the permitting side, and as you point out, the cost side.</p> <p>But in terms of tenant demand, it is extremely high for these locations. And they do have drive-throughs and they do have the conveniences that a lot of the retailers are focused on right now.</p><p><strong>Caitlin Burrows</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah, thank you. I guess, throughout the fourth quarter earnings, we've been hearing about a transaction market that's getting much more competitive and seeing compressing cap rates. I'm just wondering, given your different approach to servicing your acquisitions, are you seeing that same challenge or are you able to circumvent it?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Craig, it's a great question. And the answer is yes, we are seeing more competition for the properties that we're buying than we have historically. We are starting to see we think a fairly significant increase in volume of product that's coming on to the market. It's early days, but it does look like we are starting to see a lot more product on the market.</p> <p>The major competition is coming on the portfolio side, as you know, I mean, there's some really aggressive pricing happening on the portfolio side. On the individual asset, which is what we are buying in that smaller size sort of smaller bite size, we are -- again, we are seeing increased competition. But in terms of dramatic pricing changes, no, certainly not what we're seeing on the portfolio side. I think, there's been probably 50 basis points of compression in our markets, 25 to 50, and we think that will continue.</p> <p>As we said earlier, with Rich's question, we're seeing that 5.75% to 6.25% as the range on the cap rates. But again, we continue to selectively find the assets where we can get that 8% unlevered IRR, and that part we continue to be optimistic about.</p><p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. And then, just as the follow-up. Store closings were unusually low in '21, and they have remained so heading into '22. What are your expectations for store closing the rest of the year? And what does your watchlist look like?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>So we are -- I would say, we're optimistic this year about store closures. We don't think there's going to be a spike. We are not hearing anything that would give us a spike in store closures in the second half of this year. We did have -- we've had a lot of fallout over the last couple of years.</p> <p>And we think a lot of our retailers are on pretty stable ground right now. And the ones that we have been most concerned about, have stabilized to a big degree. We are fortunate in not having much exposure to that second anchor. And our grocers who are -- who make up 34% of our income, they're doing really well.</p> <p>And they're working through the inflation and supply chain issues in a way that we think is really positive and certainly are seeing really good results on the ground in terms of their sales. The other areas, the non-grocery, non-necessity-based, you're always watching those and how the consumer is going to be affected by that.</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Jeff, the only thing I would add to that is, Craig, on our watchlist, the largest tenants in our watchlist are in fitness, pet supplies, office supplies, on those categories. But the top five tenants on our watchlist represent less than 2.5% of our total ABR. So it's not a meaningful exposure. And as we come out of the pandemic, a lot of these retailers' businesses are improving, particularly fitness.</p> <p>So again, it's something we watch closely. But the beauty of our business model is we are highly diversified in terms of our exposure to tenants. And therefore, the watchlist exposure is well diversified.</p><p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Juan Sanabria</strong> -- <em>BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks for the time. Just a big-picture question for me. Do you have a sense of the latest trends across your portfolio from a consumer perspective just given some of the inflationary pressures, be it a headline consumer confidence today take a ding, people are clearly feeling a little more soft in a rising prices. But just curious what you guys are seeing on the ground from your pockets of consumers?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah, it's a great question. And we are watching it in real time. We continue to see strong use of our centers. And if you look at the stats, we have more customers visiting our centers today than '19.</p> <p>So that part -- and that continues happening in real time. So we're optimistic about that and looking at it sort of closely for any kind of potential changes in that. The -- but the -- certainly, you're hearing a lot about inflation and it is affecting specific retailers more than others. But I would say, overall, our view of the consumer is that -- and again, we're in the necessity part of the business.</p> <p>So we're not as variable to some of retail as others are. In our space, we would say that we're very positive about the environment that we are in right now. And we're not seeing the consumer really pulling back, particularly on the necessity side. If anything, we're seeing really solid growth, and our retailers are seeing solid growth as well.</p> <p>I don't know, Devin, if you have any other thoughts on that, but that's been --</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>I think, you nailed it, Jeff. I mean, the thing that protects us to a degree is the fact that 73% of our rents are coming from necessity-based goods, necessity retailers. And obviously, the consumer had less discretion in terms of necessity goods than they do in non-necessity goods. And so, we have not seen the current environment yet become a meaningful headwind.</p> <p>But again, it's something that we're concerned about and are watching closely.</p><p><strong>Juan Sanabria</strong> -- <em>BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">And then, just a follow-up on the balance sheet. Recognizing the ATM is maybe more just best practice and gives you optionality, but any rethinking of leverage targets to maybe keep it lower for longer and use your strong cost of capital? You guys have performed well since the IPO to kind of match on an equity perspective rather than using up the dry powder over the -- with the $1 billion target for acquisitions?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>We continue to be committed to the fact that if we can find projects that we can get an 8% unlevered IRR on a consistent basis with our strict underwriting criteria and we're buying the No. 1 or No. 2 grocer in a market that has really strong potential. So if we can do that, we're going to continue on our acquisition strategy.</p> <p>The market will drive us to reduce that. We will -- but again, we are -- as we made the big jump at the IPO, we are committed to keeping our balance sheet at investment-grade. And then, could we get up to the low-60s in terms of debt to EBITDA? Yes, that's a possibility that we will -- that the market will drive us to. But the -- so that's our strategy.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">We continue to believe there are strong opportunities to buy selectively. And at that pace of $350 million, we are not -- we're at a very cadenced acquisition pace that's not putting pressure on us to get money out, but giving us the opportunity to get the right amount out, and we'll stay disciplined on it. And that will -- but if we're getting 8% unlevered IRRs with our criteria for the grocery, we think that's a really strong -- going to give us really strong returns and be able to outpace our peers, we hope, in terms of results.</p><p><strong>Juan Sanabria</strong> -- <em>BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hey, good afternoon. First question is on the leasing spreads. I know they could be lumpy, especially on the new's side. But with that in mind, I guess, can you discuss the jump in new lease rates in the fourth quarter? Is that more an anomaly, maybe perhaps due to mix? And then, how would you assess the near-term outlook for spreads as you look at your expiring rents here over the next year or two versus market rent?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Yeah, Haendel, if you look at our new leasing spreads over time and you take the pandemic year of 2020 out of the picture and you go back to 2017 and look at 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021, the average new leasing spread for us was 14.9%. And so, the metric that we put up in 2021 of 15.7% is in line with what we've been able to do historically. So we don't tend to see the volatility in leasing spreads. I mean, if you look at that four year window, the low was 13.3% in '19 and the high was 15.9% in '17 with an average of 14.9%.</p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>That's helpful. Devin, I suppose that's perhaps more due to having less big-box space in the mix? Is that part of the sense?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>I mean, again, it's no, Haendel. One of the things that we think really differentiates us is the fact that our average center is 115,000 square feet and that ex the grocer, our average tenant is less than 2,500 square feet, and we have less exposure to the b-box retailer. And that's one of the reasons why there's less volatility in our leasing spreads than there may be in others.</p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Fair. Got it. Got it. I think, I heard, maybe it was John who mentioned this in his comments that TI dollars for leasing in the fourth quarter were higher.</p> <p>Can you talk about that a bit more? Is that a bit of an anomaly, something to do with some specific space that might have been, I don't know, for some reason, perhaps more difficult to lease? And how we should think about those -- that level of spend into 2022?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>So Haendel, you did hear that. So in the fourth quarter, they were higher dollars. And I wouldn't say it was any space in particular, absolutely the kind of cost per space does vary by the use and the size. But I would say in terms of the timing, it was higher when you look at the quarter individually.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">On both the TI and the capital side, just the capital improvements, if you look at the supplement, almost two-thirds of our capital improvements were spent in the fourth quarter. So TI is really a function of we've had increased leasing volumes. And I would say that that will carry into 2022. But I believe it was in Devin's remarks we provided some comments that it would be approximately $50 million to $55 million for that lump sum for the full year is what we're expecting.</p> <p>And that would be CI, TI, as well as leasing commissions.</p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. That's very helpful. And then, if I could, just one follow-up on an earlier comment, I think it was Craig who was asking about redevelopment. I know your projects are a bit more bite-sized, but I guess, I'm curious how you're thinking about the sizing of the overall pipeline here? Obviously, cap rates are compressing.</p> <p>There's strong demand for space. I guess, how much of a capacity or maybe a desire to make this a more meaningful contributor to earnings? I know you're guiding a few more projects this year, but not moving needle too dramatically. So I guess, I'm curious, in light of what's going on around, why not expand it more?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Haendel, it's a great question. And the answer is we do more if we could. We are working really hard to build that up. We have a really disciplined view of what we want to do on the development side.</p> <p>And it's primarily single-tenant and small multi-tenant spaces adjacent to our centers and then some of the tear down or rebuilds we do for the grocers that we get good economics on. If we could do a bigger volume, we would. We just don't -- given the timing it takes to get these up and running and the volume they're in, they're 1 million to 3 million kind of bites. It takes a lot of time and effort to get those in, and that's why we do it.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">But at the kind of returns that we're getting in that 9% to 10% return on that investment, it's a really -- it is a great vehicle. And if we could get it bigger, we would. And we will continue to work on ways to do that. But for the foreseeable future, I think looking at it as about a $50 million a year business, I think that's a good way of looking at it.</p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>That's great color. And good luck to you, guys.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yes. Thank you, Haendel.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.</p><p><strong>Mike Mueller</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Yeah, hi. So $0.47 in the fourth quarter, if we bank out a couple of cents of prior period, you're at $0.45, annualized this to about 180. I guess, the average annual -- the average quarterly number to get 220 is about $0.55. Can you help us bridge the gap in terms of the ramp from $0.45 to that average of $0.55 or the higher at the end of the year, because it seems like you get a couple of cents from or a few cents from core growth? And is the rest just acquisitions?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">So Mike, thanks for the question. On the quarter, the $0.47, one thing I would say is that, yes, there was the prior-period collections, but we did have higher expenses going through that goes through that NOI number because of the corporate kind of what we call corporate property operating. We mentioned that on the G&amp;A side that we had higher performance compensation. And that also is true for those that were in our properties because they had an amazing year as well.</p> <p>So I think, those two kind of neutralize. They kind of offset each other. And then, so when you take that, you add in the same-center growth, the acquisitions that we made in 2021, and then, the net acquisitions that we are looking at for 2022. It's really -- when you look at the jump, the core is at NOI.</p> <p>I also, in my prepared remarks, I had mentioned that on a cost level, G&amp;A actually will be pretty constant. It will be in line at about that number. And then, interest will be a little less than it was in 2021 because of the lower debt load.</p><p><strong>Mike Mueller</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. OK. And then, just thinking about your escalators, can you talk about what you were getting on 2021 leases in terms of bumps versus the in-place for the portfolio?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>John, go ahead. I wasn't sure of Mike's question, if he was asking about what the built-in rent CAGR is on new leases. Was that your question, Mike?</p><p><strong>Mike Mueller</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Yeah, yeah. Basically, what's your average in-place today? And in terms of the 2021 lease signings, how did those bumps on to new leases compared to what's in-place?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>John, go ahead.</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure. OK. Yeah, I'll go ahead and take that. So we continue to -- our new leasing and our renewal leasing, we continue to push and add embedded rent bumps that I would say are in the 2% to 2.5% range.</p> <p>I would say in the embedded base in the portfolio today that comes through an NOI at about 60 to 70 basis points. And again, that's because the 2% is primarily on our in-line neighbors. And then, when you consider that's about half of our rent that would be 100 basis points. But then in our portfolio, it wieghts to about 70 basis points.</p><p><strong>Mike Mueller</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. OK. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks, Mike.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Tammy Fique with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Tammy Fique</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. Thank you. Just a question on guidance. I'm just wondering if you can maybe help us, and you've answered this a little bit just a moment ago about the 70 basis points of contractual bumps embedded in the portfolio.</p> <p>But what are the other components of 2022 same-store NOI growth guidance? Just maybe help us frame that up beyond the 70 basis points from the rent bumps. Thank you.</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure. I'll go ahead and take that one. Thanks, Tammy. So in our 3% to 4% same-store NOI guidance, I did just mention that the rent bumps piece, we would say, is 60 to 70 basis points from the embedded portfolio.</p> <p>I would say new leasing spreads are, and again, this is for '22, 70 to 80 basis points. I would also say that redevelopment is 70 to 80 basis points. That's the outparcel projects that we've been discussing previously. The big lift is in occupancy, we have meaningfully increased occupancy, and that will continue to carry income into 2022, as well as our projections.</p> <p>And so, that's 200 to 250 basis points of our growth. And then, the math is actually similar to what is that we have about, call it, 80 basis points assumed the loss in same-center NOI related to bad debt. So in the 2022 year, we are anticipating that our bad debt will return to historical levels, which is between 60 and 80 basis points of revenue. And that range is what's giving us the 3% to 4%.</p><p><strong>Tammy Fique</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Perfect. That's really helpful. And then, I appreciate the comments around the consistency in releasing spreads. But given currently high occupancy and expectations for continued growth there, I mean, should we be thinking about bigger releasing spreads going forward if you can sustain that occupancy level or do you feel like you're putting tenants up against kind of higher occupancy costs at this point?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Tammy, it's a great question and it's one that we -- you're balancing as we get to improve the occupancy and at levels where you have more pricing power than you have -- that we've had historically. Can we realize that in higher rent spreads? The answer is, we have not assumed that in our assumptions, but we do think that there is that opportunity. We are -- and we're going to be testing that this year to see if we can do that. That's I would say it's early in terms of whether we're going to be able to go above those numbers on a go-forward basis, but we are in about as good of an operating environment as we've ever been.</p> <p>So we're hopeful that we can push those a bit.</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>And Jeff, just to add on to that. Tammy, the second part of your question was whether the pressure that we are putting on our neighbors. I would first say that our grocer health ratio we reported was 2.4%. And really, those are very long leases, so that's not really where the pressure will be applied.</p> <p>When we look at our in-line neighbors from a ratio standpoint, our estimates are we're about 10% of their cost, and that varies based on the usage. And so, as we look at the growth that they're realizing, given the necessity-based nature and their ability to push those costs, we believe we can achieve these and maintain that relationship without putting excess pressure on our neighbors.</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>The last piece is, we don't believe that our in-line tenants are feeling pressure because, as you noted in our retention rate at 88%, nine out of every 10 tenants are renewing and they're renewing at these kind of spreads that we've been talking about. So the evidence is clear that the tenants do not feel pressured. Their businesses are thriving in our centers, and therefore, they want to stay in our centers, and the retention rate is reflective of that dynamic.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Yeah. And Tammy, one thing that I would add in, as well as when you think about inflation, I mean, we've been getting these kind of spreads in a 2% inflation environment. If we were to move to 3% to 5% inflation, that would also -- we believe that would give us additional impetus to be able to grow our rental spreads, but we'll see. I mean, again, that is to be seen as we progress through the year.</p><p><strong>Tammy Fique</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. Appreciate that. And then, maybe just one last question. Just as we think about dispositions in 2022, curious if you have anything teed up there? And maybe what you're expecting for the year in total? And just if you can give us a sense for cap rates on the pool of assets that you're looking to sell?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">So as we talked about, we do know like we are -- the $350 million is a net number. So our dispose will be on top of that. So our acquisitions would be higher by whatever that number is. And that range we've given of $300 million to $400 million, we think that will be in a -- we haven't given guidance in terms of what our dispose are.</p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">I mean, historically, they've been $100 million to $125 million a year. And I think, as we think about it, we're probably thinking in that kind of a frame. But again, we're really focused on making sure that we get the incremental growth from the net acquisitions.</p><p><strong>Tammy Fique</strong> -- <em>Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Your line is open.</p><p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Thanks. Just first question, I just wanted to follow-up on investments and the strategy. There does seem to be a bit of product coming to the market.</p> <p>Is there any appetite for sort of a small or mid-sized portfolio or should we generally expect the one-offs primarily? And would there be a scenario where it might make sense to grow the joint venture and asset management platform?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Todd, thanks. Thanks for being on. It's a great question. Yes, there is additional product coming on the market.</p> <p>Yes, we are looking at every portfolio that is for sale and have looked at -- obviously, looked at all the ones that have either transacted or been committed to date. I would not anticipate us getting involved in a portfolio in the current environment where there is a large premium paid. We believe there's a portfolio of premium paid. If that continues to be the case, then we would anticipate continuing to grow through individual acquisitions.</p> <p>But again, if we can find something that meets our unlevered IRR on a portfolio basis that we think we're getting market, not a premium to market, we obviously -- we would be very -- we would love to look at that, and we would love to buy that if we can. So it's -- but again, it's going to be driven by can we underwrite it to an 8% unlevered IRR and do we think we're buying it at more of a market rate than a portfolio premium type of rate. So that's how we're kind of thinking about it. We do -- we look at basically everything that comes on the market because that's -- we've been doing this for a long time.</p> <p>We have the relationships and we're on the top of the list of anybody who is selling open-air centers to talk to us. And so, we will continue to review those and try and find the best opportunities. I don't know, Devin, if you have any other thoughts on that?</p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Yeah. The only thing I would add, Todd, is as you know, we've built this portfolio over time asset-by-asset. And the reason we haven't been successful in buying a lot of portfolios is because we believe that there is a portfolio premium that's typically paid and that makes it more difficult for us to hit our return objectives. And that would be the answer on that part of your question.</p> <p>And then, on the second part of your question regarding the asset management business, we are constantly approached by institutional investors to partner with them so that they can get the benefit of our operating platform for their investment dollars. It's something that we will continue to look closely at. And if we can find the right partner that allows us to meet our objectives for our on-balance sheet growth, etc., we would entertain it.</p><p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. And then, in terms of some of the acquisitions that you completed here in the quarter and also what's in the pipeline, I was wondering if you could speak to Arapahoe, both Arapahoe maybe and Town &amp; Country, about 200,000 square feet or a little bit more, not out of bounds. You have a number of centers that are a little bit larger in size, but they are typically larger than what the company owns today with a bunch more boxes. Should we expect to see some investments going forward be a little bit larger or a little bit boxier in nature or is it just sort of mix in the quarter?</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>I would say it's mix in the quarter. And the two -- I mean, the two centers, Arapahoe and Town &amp; Country. Town &amp; Country is a very specific case, which it does -- it is larger, but it does have two grocery-anchors. It operates as two different centers, and it's a physical-ish, you got to look at.</p> <p>But it's almost like we bought two different centers. And in that case, they are not large -- it's not a large property acquisition when you think of it as two centers. Arapahoe was a very unique situation where we felt a part of the center operated as a grocery-anchored shopping center and the majority of that, and we had two boxes that we had to buy in order to get that. And those two boxes were long-term, but good credit properties that we felt like, OK, we will take that in order to get what we really wanted, which was the grocery-anchored shopping center part of the center.</p> <p>And fortunately, to date, it's worked out extremely well, both of them from a new leasing and our ability to grow rents at both of those locations. Really early on, obviously, in their acquisition -- our ownership process. So we're very happy with sort of the progress we've made on those centers in a very short time.</p><p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">OK. And then, if I could, real quick, John, two questions related to the guidance in the quarter here. First, was there any benefit to straight-line rent realized in the quarter that we should think about moving forward or is the roughly $2 million of straight-line rent in the quarter. Is that a good run rate to think about for '22? And then, also in the core FFO reconciliation, I think there's the $0.07 to $0.08 for transaction costs and other.</p> <p>What is that exactly? And where does that show up in the income statement?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p data-uw-rm-sr=\"\">Sure. So in terms of straight-line rent, I would say that for the quarter, I would think that as I look to 2022, the fourth quarter was a little higher. I would say kind of $2 million to $2.5 million is a good estimate for straight-line rent specifically. And then, to your question on transaction costs and transaction activity, at this time, I believe those are actually going to go through on our income statement.</p> <p>I think, we have a caption right now, and I'm pulling it up. That actually is -- it's going to be in the other expense and income net line on our income statement. And then, in our reconciliations, they'll come through as that transaction and acquisition expenses, which we have as an add back to core FFO, but it does impact NAREIT FFO.</p><p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Right. And so, what is that exactly the transaction? How much of it is related to sort of abandoned or, I guess, acquisition costs versus other?</p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>So those are -- it's more a transaction over on the corporate side. So it would be -- some of it has failed transaction or failed acquisitions, but other components are just expenses that we had related to the IPO that we are paying. And it's actually some of it is non-cash expenses that we're recording going forward. So I would expect it to be at this level in 2022 and then kind of tapering from there.</p><p><strong>Todd Thomas</strong> -- <em>KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p> <p>OK. All right. Great. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>And this concludes our Q&amp;A answer session. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Edison for some closing comments.</p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you. Thanks everybody for being on the call and for your questions. We had a really nice quarter. We entered 2022 I think in a really good position.</p> <p>We are excited about some of the opportunities that's going to create for us. And again, we appreciate your questions. And obviously, we are here to answer them as we go forward. We'll root for the bangle this weekend because we have to because we got our Cincinnati base.</p> <p>But for you guys, we thank you for your time today and look forward to hopefully having a really good 2022. It's certainly starting off really well. So let's keep our fingers crossed. Thanks, guys.</p> <p>Appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>[Operator signoff]</p> <p><strong>Duration: 67 minutes</strong></p><h2>Call participants:</h2><p><strong>Michael Koehler</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p><p><strong>Jeff Edison</strong> -- <em data-uw-rm-mod=\"\">Chairman and Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p><strong>Devin Murphy</strong> -- <em>President</em></p><p><strong>John Caulfield</strong> -- <em>Chief Financial Officer</em></p><p><strong>Rich Hill</strong> -- <em>Morgan Stanley -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Caitlin Burrows</strong> -- <em>Goldman Sachs -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Craig Schmidt</strong> -- <em>Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Juan Sanabria</strong> -- <em>BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Haendel St. Juste</strong> -- <em>Mizuho Securities -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Mike Mueller</strong> -- <em>J.P.
